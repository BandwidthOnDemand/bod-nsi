        This is the Common Service Definition file that defines all parameters
        associated with the Ethernet Framed Transport Service as defined for
        the Automated GOLE network.
        
        In this example service definition document we define the Automated
        GOLE Ethernet VLAN Transport Service based on IEEE 802.1Q Trunking.
        In this service, all ports are considered E-NNI trunks, and there is
        no concept of a client UNI.

                Capacity is defined to be the average quantity of data that will be
                guaranteed to be transported per unit time from ingress to egress,
                normalized to 1 second. The "capacity" for the EVTS instance
                includes the ethernet frame header(s) but does not include sync
                bits or any inter-frame gap considerations. Further, the EVTS
                "capacity" attribute does not include any additional headers that
                may be applied in transit.

            <comment>
                Directionality specifies whether the Connect requested is to be a
                "unidirectional" or "bidirectional" circuit. The implications for
                unidirectional are fairly obvious. However for bidirectional
                connections the STPs must be defined as bi-directional. Note:
                there may be ambiguity in certain topological scenarios where the
                routing of the connection may not be clear.
